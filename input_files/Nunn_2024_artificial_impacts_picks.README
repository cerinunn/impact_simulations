Picks with smi:begin use the slope of the onset envelope to estimate the onset
time. The estimatation was performed manually. It is very subjective. 
Picks with smi:end are where the event signal is above the noise. 
The smi:begin estimate is before the signals is above the noise. 
For each event, I used all the available channels.
